<p>For the December 2023 NYC meetup, I wanted to do something special and bring some more artisan representation.  I'm pleased to announce that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/azi.keycaps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azi Keycaps</a> and I are doing a collab. These Pato Puto caps will be available at the NYC meetup in a bundle with a special Volume 2.3 zine. This colorway was inspired by an old New York Islanders logo I found and by all the New York sports team colors. Thank you very much to ej6 of Azi Keycaps for agreeing to do this project with me.</p>
<p>In addition, aqlno, the creator of the amazing <a href="https://chicagomechkb.xyz/That-Windy-City-Keebmeet-2023-d03e41cfd4ee4a7a91f76b49d9872880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hot dog artwork from That Windy City Keeb Meetup 2023</a>, created an amazing sticker design for this collab. Thank you so much aqlno for the slightly threatening duck! You can see the design in the bottom left of the zine cover but this will also be a sticker included in the bundle.</p>

<p>I have an unfortunate couple of updates:</p>
<p>Brazilian customs is on strike and Azi Keycaps and I are stuck waiting for the caps to actually ship to me from Brazil. We do not know when the package will be moving or when it will arrive to me. Therefore, I do not have the caps in hand.</p>
<p>Instead, I will be giving out dibs tickets at the meetup which will grant you entry to a private online sale exclusive to meetup attendees. The new price will be $36 + shipping now unfortunately for the bundle.</p>
<p>To enter the future sale, you will fill out the dibs ticket and send me an email at the meetup. When I have the caps, I will send everyone an email saying the sale is ready with the form. In addition to filling out the Google Form, you will need to include a picture of the dibs ticket filled out and include one of the giveaways from the meetup (cap, stickers, keyboard card, etc). If this step is missed, you will not be eligible for the sale.</p>
<p>Also 4 lucky buyers will get a Barkey in their order in addition to the Pato Puto keycap, stickers, and zine.</p>

<p>Second, I have been locked out of my @tactilezine instagram account. I'm waiting to see if I can retrieve it but if not, I'll have to create another account sadly.</p>

<p>The caps arrived on Sunday Dec 10 2023 safely. Unfortunately a week late but I'm still happy to have them. I have spent the week getting ready for the sale.</p>
<p>Also I had to create a new Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tactile_zine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@tactile_zine</a> because I cannot get into my old one.</p>

<p>I built my first keyboard in literally years and figured I'd document it because build logs are still fun.  Nothing fancy with this build. Just me learning about a bunch of new stuff along the way. Just FYI, some of the images aren't the best because I didn't realize the ultrawide lens on my camera wasn't the best until later. Also I should've checked focus or taken more pictures while I was going. Oops.</p>

<p>The kit straight from h40</p>
<p>I got this from h40 when they ran their <a href="https://h40.io/products/amano-r2?variant=41644456902809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sale for the Amano R2</a>. It's the smoke color. I decided to use the included POM plate after testing out a board at the July 2023 NYC meetup with a POM plate.</p>
<p>Throughout the build, I referenced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKXypcJg3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extrapriusplease's build stream</a> to help me along. I hadn't built a keyboard in years and there was a lot of details I had to try and remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Five" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0003-39822092e26337ada84607da96013179.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Factory lube job</p>
<p>First thing I needed to decide was what to do with the switches. I've never had the chance to just use stock switches since I have only ever built MX boards when the newest switch was the <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=75300.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zealio switches made by Gateron</a>.</p>
<p>After buying some switch samples and combing through ThereminGoat's scores, I landed on using Invokeys Black Sesame switches. However, I thought I'd have to lube the switches and springs because my samples came dry. I was surprised to learn they were factory lubed.....but I was a bit skeptical so I opened one up.</p>
<p>Turns out that I liked the switches as is. The spring feels nice and the lube job is actually not bad in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Eight" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0015-1aeffa2cbd8278db8f0464b6437a7e06.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>TX Stabilizer Stab Stoppers and Durock Screw In Stabs</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Nine" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0022-536ce0c78b054e68f4d11a34f78a032f.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Screw in and plate mounted stabilizers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Ten" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0021-1a6f29d485048e1160b5c632f7e04bae.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Stab Stoppers inserted</p>
<p>Next to figure out I'm supposed to do with my stabilizers. Weirdly the Alice builds use both a screw in and plate mounted 2x stabilizer for the spacebar. When I asked what I should use, I got different replies from different builders. I ended up using the screw in and plate mounted combo which works fine. It doesn't feel that different to me either. Also I had no idea what stab stoppers were or how to insert them so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcK_8qf-UP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video was really helpful</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Eleven" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0016-e811c6da12275020b65133532466048e.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Lubing Stabilizers</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Twelve" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0018-f90370e0f00f8d01d5172e1267388756.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>All Done!</p>
<p>Next I had to lube the stablizers. I bought some stablizer tester PCBs to help because I knew I would be handling the PCBs a lot as I tried to learn and remember how to tune the stabs. I was concerned my sweaty hands would mess with the original PCB so this was a nice peace of mind tool. I ended up using Krytox 206g0 because I forgot I had a bunch of other lubes and it was sitting out on my project desk lol. I like how it felt on the trial stabilizer set I messed with so I just kept using it.</p>
<p>Time to pop in the switches....wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Thirteen" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0026-5ab1ea3e2791349011c704761a1309ff.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Lubing Stabilizers</p>
<p>I realize I should test the PCB before I start soldering just in case. I plug in the PCB to do the tweezer testing like I see on LightningXI's streams....only to be blinded by the max brightness of the stupid LEDs on the board. I try to figure out where in Via how to turn the lighting off and it takes me a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/ha6oqz/how_to_switch_off_rgb_lights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few minutes to figure this out</a>. RIP my retinas though. Now that I'm blind, it's time to pop in the switches and solder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Fourteen" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0024-4319f69a09e98dc6284dc27e4b682e60.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Spacing tool</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Fifteen" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0025-63c0f2f8332718fe27e21d22ee44d8e5.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Popped in all the switches</p>
<p>This part is also new to me. I've never built a keyboard with a plastic plate and didnt realize how floppy it is so the spacing tool was really handy to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Sixteen" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0027-bd01f57f3afb9c9bc26d02da1e2e7847.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Soldering Setup</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Seventeen" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0028-9a781b6487fec36e2c0fdace9bb45802.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Soldering complete</p>
<p>Finished soldering and popped in the build into the top half of the case. I'm glad soldering is still easy to me and that my gear is still usable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Eighteen" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0029-1fa7be88af411c1d96cb6e5b002b93e3.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>No caps</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Nineteen" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0030-d436bcb71176d0985d0e17589f745a76.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Some caps</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Twenty" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/20231007_0031-32f6263538f2c64258092cddcefde89e.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>All the caps</p>
<p>Flipped it over and put the caps on. Because I have very old GMK sets (from 2013ish) there is not a lot of compatibilty for Alice layouts. I think I made it work though. I do another test in Via and I'm all set! Now the hardest part is to see what resin I put on the board.</p>

<p>If you've ever wondered what got me back into keyboards after 6 years away, it's pretty simple.  I was at a point in my life when I had a lot of free time and got sucked into the vtuber fandom. Between the streams I liked and still keeping up with technology, I was on YouTube pretty often. I would see recommendations for videos from Linus Tech Tips or keyboard typing samples which would remind me of the hobby. But the moment that I really remember is when Hololive Indonesia vtuber Pavolia Reine did a stream reviewing her fans' keyboards.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Reine&amp;#39;s fan said this was the JP standard layout for Hololive fans, kusa." src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/Reine-ea7ef6b0e40184aa9defb6e1b7e20b89.png" width="2220" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Reine's fan said this was the JP standard layout for Hololive fans, kusa.</p>
<p>Also IRyS talked a lot about her love for Mode and keyboards in general. I was so surprised that my little niche hobby that I was into years ago was suddenly being talked about in so many places. But surely the hobby was still small right? I thought nothing much changed since 2017...so I casually started looking into keyboards again. Obviously a lot has changed so I have a lot to learn again. Since I'm doing all this research, I figured this would be a nice time to restart my Tactile Zine series as I dive back into the hobby.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Everything the zine comes with" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/assets/images/h1-040dd52b252fc080d264586f2272b50c.jpg" width="1662" height="935" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Everything the zine comes with. Please note that the zine will not say "Draft 4F" on the cover in the final version.</p>
<p>Volume 2.1 is the first in this revival zine series. In this volume, I talked to HoffmanMyster, LightningXI, and ThereminGoat. I wanted to speak to people who have a lot of time in the hobby and are still involved. In case you're not familiar with these people and need an introduction:</p>
<p>HoffmanMyster is an old friend of mine who has been a long time community member and now Drop employee. LightningXI is a Twitch streamer who builds a lot of keyboards and the owner of the best keyboard community. And ThereminGoat writes your favorite switch reviews on his site.</p>

<p>The zines will be $10 shipped worldwide. Please note they will ship using USPS letter mail stamps.</p>
<p>The first sale of the zines will be at the Glastonbury CT NEKB Meetup - Coffee and Keyboards at RaonJena on 7/8/23. An online sale will follow soon in July 2023 with information to come. And I will have these zines for sale going forward on my site as well as at any meetups I'm attending. I will announce when the online storefront is open and has stock.</p>

<p>I know I said this in the zine but if you stumble on this post without buying the zine, thank you for your interest and support. To anyone who's been interested, talked to me about the zine, pitched an idea, let me bounce ideas off them, or just took the time to read something I posted: Thank you. I say this in the zine too as well but thank you very very much to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bustorblador/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bustorblador</a> for creating the amazing capz mosher art. And thank you to booper for giving us permission to use her sculpt for the art.</p>
<p>If you're going to any <a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/blog/s23meetups">meetups that I'm also attending</a>, I hope to see you there. I'm looking forward to hearing any feedback on Volume 2.1 and I hope you're excited for more zines to come.</p>]]></content>

<p>This summer, I'll be attending a bunch of keyboard meetups.  I wanna try out lots of new to me keyboards, switches, and see new artisan keycaps. And of course, I want to meet ya'll. Please come find me. I will have zines and stickers. I'll update this post if I plan on attending more dates.</p>
<p>I've also decided that I want to preserve the original intent of Tactile Zine 1.0. These zines will not be reprinted in any public runs. However I learned that Joey Quinn, an old reader of 1.0, was bringing the zines to meetups to show people. I thought this would be a fun way to get more people to see 1.0. So I'm happy to announce that HoffmanMyster and Joey Quinn will be have the full run of 1.0 available to bring to meetups if they choose to. HoffmanMyster has said he'll be bringing the 1.0 zine run to the Milwaukee meetup so please check it out.</p>

<h1>New Bustorblador Art!</h1>

<p>Also wanted to show off some new stickers I'll have to giveaway at meetups and include with the zines. Booper was gracious enough to allow us to use their capz sculpt as inspirious. The incredible bustorblador turned that sculpt into this super fun mosher sticker. Thanks very much! Please check them out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bustorblador/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@bustorblador</a>.</p>
<h1>Where's Tactile Zine Volume 2.1?</h1>
<p>Coming soon! I am working to have these done by 6/24 for reasons. Please look forward to that!</p>

<p>A physical zine covering the maker and creative culture around custom mechanical keyboards.  And anything adjacent. You can expect interviews with community members, commentenary from me, and other related topics. I am also running a blog as well though so I may cross-post snippets of interviews and will be writing other things. This is a revival of my original zine project</p>
<p>What's a zine? It's a physical, printed on paper, mini magazine that I am self publishing. And to keep the original vibe of the zine, this entire project is DIY. I taught myself how to self host the website. I made the stamps for the thank you notes. I write and edit everything myself. I'm going to try and work on as much art myself as I can. This is a passion project and as such, things can take some time.</p>
<p>That's not to say I don't want to work with others so if you have an idea, want to contribute, or provide some feedback, please let me know. I also want to hire some of the amazing artists I've seen in the community to provide art for the zines or stickers.</p>

<p>Currently I'm working on editing the interviews I have for the next time. That will hopefully be on soonTM. I do also have an idea for a second zine as well so that will be worked on as soon as I am finished with the other.</p>
<p>I have been posting a few things on <a href="https://tactilezine.xyz/posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my blog</a> and will continue doing so. I am interested in doing some new to me switch reviews (lol everything is new to me). I just made my first purchases on Switch Oddities and Keyleido.</p>
<p>I will be attending at least 2 meetups this summer (in Connecticut and the CannonKeys meetup). I have talked to a few people who have asked if I would reprint the 1.0 zines. My intent for those was to stay print only. However, I realize there's lots of new people who may have found the project later and wasn't able to read them. I will be bringing the 1.0 zines to the meetups so people can browse them. So I hope to see you at the meetups. I am hoping to attend more as well and will try to make the effort of bringing the 1.0 zines for people to check out. I also hope to have 2.0 zines and stickers for sale at any meetups I go to.</p>
<p>Please look forward to what's coming next!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've finally taken the plunge to start modding my Filco Zero.  I was scared to mod it as there were not very many replacement parts when I looked into it a while back (read 6+ years ago). But now with the Matias stabilizers, the easy availability of Costar stabilizers, and new DCS Alps sets available, I wanted to get the Zero updated.</p>
<p>I did cover some of my mods in a geekhack modding log but I wanted to expand on this so I had a reference in the future. Also figured it might be an interesting read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><del>I want to address the stabilizer rattle.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>I want to get the DCS Alpine Winter set I have laying around working on to my keyboard.</del></p>
</li>

<p><del>I want to address the ping on the upstroke.</del></p>

<li>
<p><del>I want to get the Pegasus Hoof working on VIA.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to replace the cable with something detachable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, I've succeeded in goals 1 through 4. Those were covered in my <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=119951.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modding log that I posted on geekhack</a>. Essentially I had to rebend the stabilizer wires, modify some of the stabilizer inserts, and sand downt he spacebar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's really nice that my hobbies work together sometimes. I was able to use a lot of the mini painting tools for the modding work in the GH thread.</p>

<li>Sanding swizzle sticks</li>

<p>There was a suggestion that there are issues with the DCS Alps sets not fitting correctly on Row 3 (homerow). People have reported that the caps might impact the wrong part of the switch and cause the travel to be shortened way more than it's supposed to. I did not encounter that issue with my caps.</p>

<p>Something I really didn't like about this keyboard is the horrible upstroke ping when the switches were actuated. I was going to buy a foam mat or PE foam to put into the keyboard case but stumbled into the tape mod idea. Figured this was easy enough to try since I already had the tape on hand. I tried it out and it looks jank/10 but it works at like an 7/10. I expected nothing so I was very surprised. I am still interested in buying a foam mat or PE foam to see if I can remove the tape and just rely on those foam options. I just want to remove the ping though.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=119951.msg3177357#msg3177357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speedycake in LightningKeyboard's Discord server</a> I was able to get Via working on the Pegasus Hoof controller. The firmware was ported over to QMK earlier in 2023 but I didn't realize how to get it working. So essentially the steps I followed were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set the controller to DFU mode with the magnetic reset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the Pegasus Hoof firmware from <a href="https://www.caniusevia.com/docs/download_firmware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this website</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the QMK toolbox tool to flash the firmware. I'd need to select the atmega32U2</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I confirmed that I have a 2013 Pegasus Hoof <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=71855.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from my old build log when I modded my Zero</a>. And confirmed my controller was running an old <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51252.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EasyAVR firmware</a>. So I grabbed the 2013 Pegasus Hoof firmware.</p>
<p>Next I booted up my Windows Virtual Machine and installed <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QMK toolbox</a>. Then reset my controller with a magnet and passed the USB input into the VM. I set the MCU type to atmega32U2 and then flashed the hex file from Caniusevia.com. Once it's done, I just booted up Via and it worked!</p>
<p>I'm very happy to have my decade old controller and keyboard in the modern age!</p>
<p>Lastly, thanks to some new interest in Filcos, some friends are putting together a little buy from <a href="https://keebstuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeebStuff</a> so that we can get a Filco cable that attaches into the Filco board connector and terminates into a female LEMO end. That way I can have one LEMO cable for all of my boards...wait, I need to figure out what to do with my Kishsaver now. That's another project for another day.</p>]]></content>
