First, Reddit posts said that the PCB files provided had some issues and that minor tweaks were needed, but I didn't know what those fixes were. Second, I'd be stuck with a very weird layout, and the MX switches stuck up very obviously. The mod and project are so cool but looked kinda janky. So, I kinda forgot about it for a while, like a year. I'm not sure why, but one day I was looking at the device again and decided to poke around to see if there were any developments. I had been casually looking for months for something I could work on writing projects on while sitting on the couch. I almost bought a few other things and then remembered that the AS3K mechanical keyboard mod was a thing. This time I noticed someone on Reddit advertising that they'd be selling AS3K mod kits on Etsy. And the PCB could take MX as well as Choc V1s! Finally, I could upgrade this weird little device and I had an excuse to look at Choc switches again.

The clickys are decent and remind me of the box clickys Kailh makes. Those aren't my favorite, as they just feel like a meme version of even MX blues or any good clicky switch like SKCM blue, Hi-Tek 725 black clickys, or buckling springs. They're just heavy for no reason and have that annoying plasticky click. Bleh.
